    The idea behind this is to allow a context tensor less or equal dimensions to be
    concatenated to an input with more dimensions.
    This function checks the dimension difference and reshapes the context to have
    the same dimension as the constituents so broadcast concatenation can apply.
    The shape change always assumes that the first dimension is the batch and the last
    are the features.

    Here is a basic use case: concatenating the high level jet variables to the
    constituents during a forward pass through the network
    - The jet variables will be of shape: [batch, j_features]
    - The constituents will be of shape: [batch, num_nodes, n_features]
    Here the jet variable will be shaped to [batch, 1, j_features] allowing broadcast
    concatenation with the constituents

    Another example is using the edge features [b,n,n,ef] and concatenating the
    high level jet variables, which will be expanded to [b,1,1,jf] or the conditioning
    on the node features which will be expanded to [b,1,n,nf]
