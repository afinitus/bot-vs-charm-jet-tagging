### Forking Workflow

If you want to contribute to the development of the GNN, you should create a [fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html) of the repository.
You can read about forking workflows [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), or take a look at the contributing guidelines in the [training dataset dumper documentation](https://training-dataset-dumper.docs.cern.ch/development/#contributing-guidelines).

You should make changes inside a [feature branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/feature_branch_workflow.html) in your fork. It is generally a good idea not to work directly on the the `main` branch in your fork. Then, when your feature is ready, open a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) to the target branch on upstream (which will usually be `main`). Once this is merged to upstream, you can `git pull upstream main` from your fork to bring back in the changes, and then fork again off `main` to start the development of a new feature. If your feature branch becomes outdated with its target, you may have to rebase or merge in the changes from the target branch, and resolve any conflicts, before you can merge.

Remember to keep you fork [up to date](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/12/01/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-its-origin/) with upstream.

### Code Standards

Good coding standards are highly encouraged.
You can take a look at the [umami docs](https://umami-docs.web.cern.ch/setup/development/) or the coding style [tutorial](https://ftag.docs.cern.ch/software/tutorials/tutorial-coding/) for guidance on code style.
In short, aim to write clean readible code with plenty of module and function docstrings, and inline comments.
Code is formatted using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) (this is enforced by the pre-commit checks).


### Pre-commit Checks

The `pre-commit` framework is used to ensure contributions follow good coding standards.
It is installed as a package dependency.
To set it up, just run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit checks will then be run every time you run `git commit`.
You can run them manually over staged changes using

```bash
pre-commit run
```

Include the `--all-files` flag if you want to run the checks over all the files in the repository.


### Test Suite

From the top level directory of the repository, run

```bash
pytest
```

??? info "Checking code coverage"

    If you want to check the coverage of the test suite, you can instead
    run the tests using `coverage`.

    ```bash
    coverage run --source salt -m pytest
    coverage report
    ```
