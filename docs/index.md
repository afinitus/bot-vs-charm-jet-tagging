Welcome to the Salt framework documentation.
Salt is a general-purpose framework to train state-of-the art jet flavour tagging algorithms such as GN1.

The code is hosted on CERN GitLab:

[https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/salt](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/salt)

You can find information about different taggers at the central FTAG algorithms [docs pages](https://ftag.docs.cern.ch/algorithms/GNN/).

General discussions about GNNs take place on Mattermost [here](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/aft-algs/channels/gnns).
